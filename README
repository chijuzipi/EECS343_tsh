What you will find here:

README - what you are looking at

Makefile - Makefile for the whole project, remember to update your
	team name. As in your previous project there are two
	less-common targets you need to be aware of: test-reg and
	handin.

config.h - Project config files

tsh.[hc], interpreter.[hc], io.[hc], runtime.[hc] - Some basic
	structure for your shell project. You don't have to follow the
	provided organization, just satisfy the specs. 

tsh.1 - For a man page on your tsh

grading-guide.txt - Grading policy and general guide. It tells you
	what we are looking for, explains how we grade your project,
	what the test cases are and how we use them.

testsuite - A directory including the test cases described in
	grading-guide.txt, as well as the test harness.

What you should do first:

First thing to do now is compile the project skeleton.

[fabianb@localhost tsh_skeleton]$ make
gcc -Wall -g -D HAVE_CONFIG_H   -c -o interpreter.o interpreter.c
gcc -Wall -g -D HAVE_CONFIG_H   -c -o io.o io.c
gcc -Wall -g -D HAVE_CONFIG_H   -c -o runtime.o runtime.c
gcc -Wall -g -D HAVE_CONFIG_H   -c -o tsh.o tsh.c
gcc -o tsh interpreter.o io.o runtime.o tsh.o

Among other things you should now have the executable 'tsh'. Go ahead
and run it

[fabianb@localhost tsh_skeleton]$ ./tsh
exit

All it understands for now is 'exit', not very interesting but
something to get started. 

Just before getting into the serious work, try making the handin

[fabianb@localhost tsh_skeleton]$ make handin
rm -f *.o *~
rm -f  myteam-1-tsh.tar.gz
tar cvf myteam-1-tsh.tar config.h interpreter.c  interpreter.h  io.c  io.h  Makefile  tsh.1  tsh.c  tsh.h  README  runtime.c  runtime.h
config.h
interpreter.c
interpreter.h
io.c
io.h
Makefile
tsh.1
tsh.c
tsh.h
README
runtime.c
runtime.h
gzip myteam-1-tsh.tar

This would leave a tar-gzip ball (which name will start with your
team's name) in the same directory. This is what you need to submit to
us when ready.

Good luck
