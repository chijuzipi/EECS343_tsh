sdriver.pl
	Driver program that runs a student's shell program as a child, sends 
	commands and signals to the child as directed by a trace file,
	and captures and displays the output produced by the child.

test*.in
	Trace files that test different aspects of a shell implementation.
	For example, does the shell recognize the quit command, can it
	run a foreground job, does it handle ctrl-c and ctrl-z correctly.

myspin.c
mysplit.c
mystop.c
myint.c
	Little programs that the traces use to test the shell.
	myspin <secs> sleeps for <secs> seconds, 1 second at
	a time. mysplit.c forks a mysplin-like child. mystop.c
	sleeps for several seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself.
	myint.c sleeps and sends SIGINT to itself.  

README-handout
	The Makefile and README that are handed out to the students.
