Test Cases: 

We will use the following test cases (and the associated test suite)
to evaluate and grade your project.  All test cases end with the
"exit" command.

1) background job
2) multiple background jobs, and the jobs command
3) background and foreground jobs
4) multiple background jobs, and the jobs command
5) background and foreground jobs

11) background and foreground jobs, ctrl-z signal, fg command
12) background and foreground jobs, ctrl-z signal, bg command
13) background job, fg command, ctrl-z, fg command
14) ctrl-z, bg and fg commands on the same job
15) ctrl-c signal

Using the sdriver.pl driver script:

To automatically test your project, we use the testsuite/sdriver.pl
script to send signals to your shell.  As described in the handout,
you can run the driver from the testsuite directory:

./sdriver.pl -t testXX.in -s .././tsh

To see the output of the reference implementation, replace ".././tsh"
with "./tsh-ref".
